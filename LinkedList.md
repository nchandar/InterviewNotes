# LinkedList

## Linked list vs Arrays

| S.No  | Arrays                                       | Linked Lists            |
| :---: |:-------------                                | :--------------------   |
|   1   | Fixed Size                                   | Dynamic Size            |
|   2   | Inefficient insertion and deletion           | Efficient insertion and deletion |
|   3   | Random Accessing (i.e efficient indexing).   | No Random Accessing     |
|       | Eg. Can retrive a element randomly using the index value like a[5] to get the 6th element in the array. |                                              
|   4   | Results in memory waste due to declaring the size of the array upfront and if its not used| No memory waste.|
|   5   | Sequential Access is faster. Since elements are in contiguous Memory location.| Sequential Access is slow. Since elements are not in contigous memoru location.|
