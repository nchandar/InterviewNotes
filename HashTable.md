# Hash Table

<ol>
<li>Hash Table combines the random Access ability of the array with the dynamisim of the linked list.</li>
<li>So in hash table Insertion, Deletion and look up takes up only constant time which is <b>O(1)</b></li>
<li>Hash Tables over comes the disadvantages of using a linked list and an array.
  <ul>
    <li>Disadvantage of using a array - Specificing an constant size and when an array is dynamically resized its expensive.</li>
    <li>Disadvantage of using a linked list - It is harder to traverse/lookup a specific value in a linked list when the size of the linked list gets bigger.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ol>
